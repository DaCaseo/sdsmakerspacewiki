# Laser Cutter
The laser cutter uses a laser to  into flat surfaces of soft materials like wood, acrylic, and leather. SVG designs can be uploaded to it to control what it cuts. It can also etch and score material.

## Overview
[[insert top down view picture]]
This is a top-down view of the laser cutter.

## Creating a Design
Designs for the laser cutter come in a number of forms but the most common (and accurate!) is an SVG or Scalable Vector Graphics file. These end in `.svg` and can be found online or created with compatible programs such as [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html) or [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/). This guide won't cover how to use these programs but you can find an endless amount of tutorials online or ask someone who does know. 
## Uploading and placing a Design
> In order to use the laser cutter you will need a [Glowforge account](https://app.glowforge.com/). If you don't have an account [contact Case](mailto://case.norris@sdsgriffin.org) to get set up.

Once you are logged into glowforge you should see a screen like this:


![glowforge_home.png](/laser_cutter/glowforge_home.png){.elevation-3 .radius-5}

This is the home screen. It has all of the designs you have uploaded in the past as well as some ones included by default. Go ahead and click create. It should prompt you with a few options. 

![create_new_design_prompt.png](/laser_cutter/create_new_design_prompt.png)

You can upload new designs at any time from within their menu so don't worry too much about which one to choose right now. If you don't already have a design downloaded, just click *New blank design*. You should be greeted with this screen.

If it seems confusing right now, that's alright it should make a lot more sense in just a bit.

The highlighted area is the camera view. It displays what the camera at the top of the laser cutter sees inside the machine. In this case there is nothing, but anything you put inside the machine should appear on this screen after closing the lid.

The blue plus button on the top middle of the screen is how you add new designs. When you click on it you should see something like this.

The most important button here is the upload button on the top right of this dialog. It allows you to upload any design you've made or any pictures you've found online. If you're wondering what kind of files you can upload, click [here](https://glowforge.com/faq/design#which-design-platforms-does-glowforge-work-with). While it's possible to upload just about any picture or design you can find, note that not all of them will print well or give you the result you might want. Files that "print well" typically have clear outlines and not many filled in areas. You can find a guide on identifying easily printable files online [here](/en/refrences/printable-files).

After uploading or placing a design it will appear inside the editor. You can drag the design around to control where it will be cut and control the size of it by dragging one of the corners.

On the left side of the screen is is a list of all designs (or parts of single designs) you have uploaded.
