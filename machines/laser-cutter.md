# Laser Cutter
The laser cutter uses a laser to  into flat surfaces of soft materials like wood, acrylic, and leather. SVG designs can be uploaded to it to control what it cuts. It can also etch and score material.

## Overview
[[insert top down view picture]]
This is a top-down view of the laser cutter.
## The Process

1. [Creating a design](https://sdsmakerspace.dacaseo.me/en/machines/laser-cutter#creating-a-design)
2. [Uploading and placing a design](https://sdsmakerspace.dacaseo.me/en/machines/laser-cutter#uploading-a-design)
3. [Cutting a design](https://sdsmakerspace.dacaseo.me/en/machines/laser-cutter#cutting-a-design)

## Creating a Design
Designs for the laser cutter come in a number of forms but the most common (and accurate!) is an SVG or Scalable Vector Graphics file. These end in `.svg` and can be found online or created with compatible programs such as [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html) or [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/). This guide won't cover how to use these programs but you can find an endless amount of tutorials online or ask someone who does know. 
## Uploading and placing a Design
> In order to use the laser cutter you will need a [Glowforge account](https://app.glowforge.com/). If you don't have an account contact [Case](mailto://case.norris@sdsgriffin.org) to get set up.

Once you are logged into glowforge you should see a screen like this:


![glowforge_home.png](/laser_cutter/glowforge_home.png){.elevation-3 .radius-5}

This is the home screen. It has all of the designs you have uploaded in the past as well as some ones included by default. Go ahead and click create. It should prompt you with a few options.

You can upload new designs at any time from within their menu so don't worry too much about which one to choose right now. If you don't already have a design downloaded, just click *New blank design*. You should be greeted with this screen.

If it seems confusing right now, that's alright it should make a lot more sense in just a bit.

The highlighted area is the camera view. It displays what the camera at the top of the laser cutter sees inside the machine. In this case there is nothing, but anything you put inside should appear on this screen after closing the lid.

You will notices that it says that the laser cutter is offline in the top right. It can be turned on with a switch in the back next to the power cable.
