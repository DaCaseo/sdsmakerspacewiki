# Machines
There are quite a few machines in the makerspace in both of the rooms. 
## Right Room
The room on the right of the hallway is carpeted and contains most of the fabrication and sewing machines. This is a list of everything in this room.
- **Laser Cutter** - Uses a high-powered laser to cut flat surfaces. It can cut wood, acrylic, cardboard, and leather.
- **3D Printer** - Uses plastic to print out any 3D object uploaded to it.
- **Vinyl Cutter** - Cuts vinyl in a pattern uploaded to it to make stickers and decals.
